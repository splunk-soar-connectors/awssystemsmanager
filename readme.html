<b>Authorization</b><br></br>

Upon installing AWS Systems Manager and configuring your asset, you will want to make sure your AWS account (preferably with Administrator privileges) has the following permissions:<br></br>

<ul>
  <li>The AmazonSSMFullAccess policy is attached directly to the account</li>
  <li>Ability to read and write to S3 buckets</li>
</ul>

<h2> Playbook Backward Compatibility</h2>
<ul>
  <li> A new asset configuration parameter has been added in v2.0 of the app. Hence, it is requested to the end-user to update their existing assets and playbooks accordingly.</li>
    <ul>
      <li> Default S3 Bucket Name: This parameter defines the default AWS S3 bucket to be used for writing the output of the <b>get file</b> and the <b>execute program</b> actions. For performance optimality, the <b>test connectivity</b> action does not validate this parameter.</li>
    <ul>
</ul>

By default, AWS Systems Manager does not have permission to perform actions on your instances. You must make sure to attach the AmazonEC2RoleforSSM IAM policy to the instance that you want to manage with SSM.

For more information on setting up your account and instances with SSM privileges, visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_run_command.html">AWS tutorial</a>.
